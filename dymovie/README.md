## üíª Project
An app developed with the goal of allowing people to rate movies and share their experiences,
leading other users to watch them too, regardless of the streaming platform the movie is on.

## ü§ì Personal Goal
My initial goal with this project is not to create a product to be released to the market,
but rather to develop skills related to React, from the beginning to the end of an application
covering as many resources offered by this framework as possible and to be entirely of my own authorship.

## üîñ Layout
